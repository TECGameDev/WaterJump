Vand for Alle Tider - Awareness Game
====================================

### Project Overview

This project is part of the **"Vand for Alle Tider"** initiative with the [National Museum of Denmark](https://natmus.dk/museer-og-slotte/sumo/projects/vand-fra-alle-tider/). The initiative focuses on raising awareness among young people about climate change, water flooding, and the impacts on our environment. Our team was tasked with developing an engaging game to support the project's mission, encouraging players to learn about climate challenges in a fun and interactive way.

### Game Objective

The game immerses players in scenarios related to water and climate challenges, aiming to:

-   Increase awareness about flooding and its causes.
-   Highlight the effects of climate change on urban environments.
-   Encourage proactive thinking about climate resilience and sustainability.

### Game Mechanics

-   **Player Goals**: Players navigate through levels, each representing a different climate or flooding scenario, to reach checkpoints or complete challenges.
-   **Gameplay Elements**: Interactive obstacles, rising water levels, and time-based challenges that reflect real-world environmental issues.

### How to Play

-   The game is controlled with simple touch and movement mechanics.
-   Players can use left-right controls and a variable jump mechanic to overcome obstacles.

### Development Team
This project was developed by a small team of programming students from TEC - Technical Education Copenhagen.
